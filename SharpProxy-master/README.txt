SharpProxy is a simple proxy server developed with the intent of being able to open up local ASP.NET development servers.

This allows you to test, hit breakpoints, and generally do development by using other machines and mobile devices.

Simply enter the local port number of your .NET development server and map it with an external port to host on.
